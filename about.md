## Hello

##### [Please note this page is still under construction]


I'm a Computer Engineering (CoE) student at Pitt, and a research intern with [CHREC](http://www.iucrc.org/center/nsf-center-high-performance-reconfigurable-computing).
There, I investiage what technologies, topologies, and tradeoffs can help in the design of embedded sensor networks.

I'm a big (programming) language nerd, spending most of my time learning about Haskell or Rust.
I also like to noodle around with C++; check out my GitHub account (linked above) to check out some of the projects I'm working on. You can also find the project I use to build this very site.
