## About Me

Hello all! I am a computer engineer (software and FPGA) at
[Concurrent EDA](http://concurrenteda.com) in Pittsburgh,
and a proud alumnus from Pitt's Swanson School of Engineering.

At work, I have designed, implemented, tested, and debugged:

- Low-level Ethernet drivers
- Bare-metal DMA controller software
- FPGA logic for high-speed video
- Embedded Linux applications
- And many, many shell scripts
