Welcome to my blog! Thanks for coming!
I'm going to be writing about the technology and culture I'm interested in.
Yes, yet another developer blog, but I have found many blogs very helpful
in my journey, and I would like to be able to contribute back for others to find.

But anyway, this is the second paragraph in my first post.
One really cool thing about Hugo is that you can start a server which will
automatically update the web page as soon as the source files are changed.
